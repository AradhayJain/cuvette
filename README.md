The Job Tracker App is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It allows recruiters to post job openings and manage applicants, while job seekers can explore listings and track their application status.

**Key Features**


User authentication and role-based access (Applicant or Recruiter)
Recruiter dashboard to add, delete job posts
Applicant dashboard to browse jobs and apply
Track application status dynamically
Clean UI with responsive design
Protected routes for secure navigation
Integration with MongoDB for data persistence

**Technologies Used**


Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Hosting: render

**Folder Structure**


/frontend - React app for client-side
/backend - Express server with APIs
/models - Mongoose models for User, Job, Application
/routes - Route handlers for user, job, and application APIs
/controllers - Logic for API endpoints

**How to Run Locally**

Clone the repository
Set up .env files for backend configuration
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
Run backend server
Run frontend React app

**Future Improvements**


Add file upload for resumes
Implement notifications for application updates
Add search and filter options for job listings
Admin dashboard for system monitoring
